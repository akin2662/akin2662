  <strong >Who am I?</strong>
</p>

Hey! I'm Advait Kinikar, a **Robotics Engineer** in making, an **AI enthusiast**  and  always a professional **debugger of my own code**. Currently pursuing my **Master‚Äôs in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park**. I have hands-on experience with **robotic perception, planning, and control** and have spent countless hours my fine-tuning **Gazebo** simulations.

ü§ñ Robotics & Autonomous Systems

* Kinematics & Dynamics: I have a strong understanding of forward/inverse kinematics, differential kinematics, and dynamic modeling of robotic systems (Lagrangian & Newton-Euler methods).

* Motion Planning & Control: I have implemented Artificial Potential Fields (APF) for obstacle avoidance, Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) for path planning, and PID controllers for motion control in mobile robots.

* Perception: I have used OpenCV for image processing, object detection, and feature extraction

üîÑ Robot Simulation & Middleware

* ROS2: I have developed modular robotic systems in ROS2 using nodes, topics, services, actions, and tf2 transformations for communication.

* Gazebo Simulation: I have built realistic physics-based simulations for robot testing

* MoveIt!2: I have experience with motion planning and execution for robotic arms

ü§ñ Machine Learning & AI for Robotics

* Supervised & Unsupervised Learning: I have implemented SVM, SOM, PCA, Logistic Regression algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

* Deep Learning: I have CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image processing and perception tasks, and experimented with RNNs/LSTMs for sequential data modeling.

* Reinforcement Learning: Developed AI agents DQN and PPO for strategy-based decision-making.

üõ†Ô∏è Programming & Software Development

* Python & C++:  I have strong Python skills for ML, AI, and robotics development; currently improving C++ for real-time robotics applications.

* SymPy, NumPy, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow: I have used these and more libraries for robotics development, ML model training, computer vision, and deep learning applications.

* Pygame & Game Development: I have developed a turn-based strategy game using custom AI agents trained via RL.
